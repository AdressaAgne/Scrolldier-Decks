Woot!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatons have been a favorite deck of mine since replicaton and echomaton were released and the idea of a late-game deck that would excel in the early game through the board grabbed my attention. My original version of the deck was built half for fun and half as a counter to late-game growth. It turned out that it was also pretty good against energy so it worked well during the powertrip era. Energy is such an adaptive resource that it was able to survive a couple metas after the powertrip nerf until the nerf to echomaton really killed the deck. With both of thoose scrolls back (albeit weaker versions) the deck can thrive again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why Scrolls?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Copper Automaton- Copper is the king of the aggro matchups and works out great for willing the opponent to activate spells. With scouts can take out every unbuffed creature and deal with pesky armor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Useless Contraption- Far from useless the 4 health is so very good and always good for adding to machine chant plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Gun Automaton- Standard 2-2-3 but with scout can often get to 3 and up. All around really good in all stages of the game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Hired Smuggler- Good in the early game and also serves the purpose of making your opponent play spells.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Spark- Smuggler, Braves, Mire shamblers, Aging knight, and Vaettr spark kills them all. Good in early game and still useful in late-game with state-machines or just extra damage needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Scout Automaton- Armor one very useful and the attack buff is amazing. One of if not the best scroll in the deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Replicaton- Scatter gunner with an awesome abillity most useful in late-game but in early game not terrible. Don&#39;t be afraid to go below 2 resources but not without good reason.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Automata Forge- Good in the grind game and good as a wall. Where to play forges really depends on matchup and board state but given the squishyness of our creatures front row is usually best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x State Machine- Really good against everything works well with single target removal and out generally weak automatons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Oculus Cannon- Only really useful with bombard or against decay but can be good for adding that little bit of machine chant damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Powertrip- Back from the dead decent in the early game for tempo swings and obviously very good in late-game. Sacced fairly often but when its good its great.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Bombard- Depending on hand usually sacced early game but excels in mid to late-game the &quot;nerf&quot; didn&#39;t really hurt it in automatons at all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Echomaton- Great against energy and order decent against decay and depends on the type of growth, but all around echomaton is one of the reasons the deck works and adds even more utility to copper automaton.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Solemn Giant- Can be good in early game depending on matchup and very good in the late-game for both lethal and pushing on other late-game based decks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Burn- Very good scroll and works especially well with state machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Machine Chant- Don&#39;t run a massive amount of structures so not as good as it is in MES but definitely still good in certain situations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Thunder Surge- Often the threat of surge will do you more good than the actual surge but good for when its good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Violent Dispersal- I am not a big fan of dispersal, but with arby&#39;s and great wolfs running rampant it has proved useful since i added it back in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not Scrolls?

A good tempo order player can end the game as early as turn 6-7 as it is one of the fastest competitive decks in the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets dive into it. Here is the Tempo order deck that i personally use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tempo Order is a rush deck through and through. It uses it&rsquo;s solid early game creatures, flexible displacement spells and powerful countdown manipulation to completely dominate the early and mid game. The focus of the deck &nbsp;is therefore placed in creatures and ways to support them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will now break down the individual scrolls in the deck to give you a sense of &nbsp;why every scroll is there, when it should be played and how it should be played (from lowest cost to highest cost. )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aging Knight</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This creature embodies what this deck is about. a mad dash to the finish that dies out if you can&rsquo;t make it. He is the strongest early game creature currently in the game, but only for a little while. You can use him to contest early creatures if you go second, &nbsp;or just place an immediate threat on the board in the later stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blessing of Haste</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://scrolldier.com/resources/cardImages/530.png" style="height:225px; width:300px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This spell is in nearly every Order deck ever conceived, it&rsquo;s that damn good. &nbsp;You can use this to screw over your opponent&rsquo;s math by making units attack earlier than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crossbowman</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This creature is so cheap that it needs to attack ONCE for it to be worth it. &nbsp;A 1 cost creature that deals 4 damage as it&rsquo;s base attack is ludicrous and if combined with any sort of countdown reduction it can be devastating. &nbsp;A good way to use crossbowman &nbsp;can be to finish off idols or break the beefy 4 health blockers that almost every faction has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This card + relentless = &nbsp;untold amounts of pain for your enemies. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s cheap cost means you can easily play this while dropping another creature to keep your tempo up. . You should use this card to kill creatures that would otherwise be out of reach healthwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ducal Infantryman</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good early game blocker and an incredible ability to boot. This unit is in here because it works well with every creature that order has. &nbsp;You should aim to have this in the back in the mid game and use it&rsquo;s damage boost to give your units the ability to plow through even the toughest blockers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flip</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to control where you opponent&rsquo;s units are, allows you to make some pretty sick trades. It can allow you to either move the opponent to you, or move a unit out of the way to get to some meatier targets. either way it&rsquo;s a great all around scroll if you&rsquo;re looking to dominate the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pother</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Same principle as flip. Only it draws you a card, allowing you to keep your hand size healthy. The drawback lies in the limited range and the randomness. you can eliminate the randomness by targeting specific creatures that only have one or 2 places to go. &nbsp;You can also use it on your own creatures to get them one space further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Roasted Bean Potion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This card was terrible back in the day, now it&rsquo;s borderline overpowered. &nbsp;If &nbsp;you play this on a creature in the middle row, it can hit every lane on the entire board. Ideally you will be using this to surprise your enemy and killing a previously out of reach unit, furthering your board advantage in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wings Soldier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decent early game creature. great as a card played in tandem with other support cards, since it has the potential to make some pretty neat trades if supported properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wings Warder</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is anything this deck doesn&rsquo;t like, it&rsquo;s removal. you want your opponent to feed creatures to your meat grinder and that doesn&rsquo;t happen if he can just sit behind his idols and chuck spells at you. This unit can help you keep your key creatures &nbsp;on the board and thus, keep your board presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Decimation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This card is essential to the general Tempo Order strategy. It allows you to finish the game after you&rsquo;ve lost the ability to do it with creatures. A common strategy i use is to leave some idols at 1-4 health and then snipe them later with decimations. this allows you to focus on the board or the other idols. and if your opponent spends time trying to defend it, then all the better for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Royal Skirmisher</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This creature is considered part of the bread and butter order. It&rsquo;s cheap cost and amazing attribute allows you to make favourable trades and cut through any cheap chump block that your opponent plonks down. &nbsp;Combo with damage increase for extra degrees of slaughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more late game oriented version of Blessing of Haste. It&rsquo;s in this deck because all the countdown reduction in order is good (soldiers bond excluded). You can drop this with &nbsp;crossbowman for a 4 cost suprise attack. Other than that, you shouldn&rsquo;t be holding on to this card if you have better options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wings Shield</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>this creature is very tough to deal with. You should always be aiming to have the 2 armour boost which means that using anything less than 2 units to kill it becomes tough. and since you have 2 units behind it at all times it leaves your enemy exposed to a poop storm of pain and dying units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ducal Skirmisher</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On sight this creature appears worse than royal skirmisher, but 4 health is the magic number in scrolls. It allows it to survive most removal and can be used as an effective blocker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wings Captain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion the best creature in the game. This creature allows you to engage out of reach creatures or maneuver your own creatures into better organised ranks, once this creature is out, the worst mistake your opponent can make is trying to run from you. Keep in mind that the movement buff only works with soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Royal Vanguard</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of your finishing cards. The vanguard allows you to make some right out disgusting trades if played right. any damage increase + relentless is devastating. His high cost means that he can&rsquo;t be comboed with other cards very well though, so make sure you have some breathing room before you play him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok that was the deck breakdown. Now let&rsquo;s look at the general strategy when we&rsquo;re playing it in an actual match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening hand / Mulligan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ideal opening hand includes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) A 1 cost creature. &nbsp;(aging knight, crossbowman)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) A 2- cost creature or spell. (ducal infantryman, wings soldier, blessing of haste, wings warder, etc)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)A 3 cost creature (see a pattern forming? Royal skirmisher is ideal here although any 2 cost creature can substitute)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) A 4 cost creature (Wings Captain, Ducal Skirmisher)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at the explanation above, you should see that we aim to drop a creature almost every turn. This is what you want to be able to do. Your ideal hand can be almost anything as long as you can play a creature every turn. If you can&rsquo;t play something for at least three of the first five turns of the match, then you should mulligan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>early game (1-5 resources)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should look to play creatures and secure the board. &nbsp;Slaughter everything your opponent brings out and try and wreck your opponent in the first 10 turns of the game. (or at least get him to a point where he&rsquo;s incredibly far behind)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>mid game (5-6) resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longer the game goes on. The worse it is for you. You should hopefully be in a place where you can switch your focus from creatures to idols. try and get your opponent within 6 idol health of losing so you can decimate him from there. if you can&rsquo;t do that then you will find yourself in a position where you will slowly be removed from the board. (unless you&rsquo;re versus another tempo deck. in that case just keep playing creatures and try to eliminate theirs)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Late game</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>you don&rsquo;t have one, don&rsquo;t even try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of the meta dictates that every deck has something that wrecks it. this is what i like to call</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>STUFF THAT SCREWS YOU OVER</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>QUAKE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>this card is good at wiping your board. and getting your board wiped usually means a swift defeat. you can combat this by prioritising high health creatures and play more creatures in between quakes. really though, this card is just &nbsp;hell to deal with</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>BOMBARD/GODHAND/RALLY/NECROGEDDON</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>board wide countdown reduction is hard to deal with. it&rsquo;s even harder to deal with when you deck has no comeback scrolls. &nbsp;try and keep these scrolls in mind when playing against the respective decks that run them. kill creatures with high damage and try to predict when the card comes out. It can save the game for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BLOODLINE TAINT + INFECTIOUS BLIGHT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This combo kills tempo order. Heck it kills order in general. Since every creature you play is a human, every creature is affected by bloodline taint. This means that infectious blight will wreck havoc on you. Try and keep your unit with the blight in the front row, your opponent will want to not kill it. Use a decimation to kill your unit with the blight on it if you can. other than that, there really isn&rsquo;t a lot to do against this combo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SUDDEN ERUPTION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Same reasons as quake. You can sort of counter this card by having a lot of creatures since your opponent might not have enough energy to hit every creature you have</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can manage to play around these things, then tempo order is a really difficult deck to deal with and has had a lot of success on the ladder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not have every card you need to put this deck together. but there are a lot of different scrolls you can use to replace those you don&rsquo;t want or don&rsquo;t have. Lets take a look at a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Purification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Works well against the dreaded infectious blight and also has a devastating effect on the Mono Growth Enchantment deck that is going around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kabonk</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great for getting that one damage needed to kill a creature and nets you a card to boot</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reversal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excellent substitute for flip or pother since it both draws you a card and can usually give you an effect similar to either scroll</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wings Cleaver</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great finisher. Some of the best tempo order players in the world will swear by this scroll. It can cut through just about anything your opponent summons and you can make it attack almost every turn if you draw your countdown reduction scrolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eternal Sword</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone i have talked to say this is borderline overpowered. I haven&rsquo;t tested it enough as of writing, which is why it isn&rsquo;t in the deck, but it can give you some flat out silly trades if you can keep it on the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was everything i had for this edition. Keep on scrolling buddies!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":36,"c":3},{"id":54,"c":3},{"id":55,"c":2},{"id":57,"c":3},{"id":64,"c":3},{"id":71,"c":3},{"id":116,"c":3},{"id":121,"c":3},{"id":122,"c":3},{"id":125,"c":3},{"id":127,"c":3},{"id":193,"c":3},{"id":206,"c":3},{"id":232,"c":3},{"id":237,"c":3},{"id":254,"c":3},{"id":298,"c":3}],"name":"Tempo Order","deleted":0,"resources":["order"]},"apiversion":1}', 1, 0, '', NULL),

With a lategame curve, a ton of removal, and 3 Metal Wonders, this decks main purpose is to counter lategame Wild decks. The main thing I&#39;m looking for in a starting hand with this deck is at least one spark or burn to help stall the game out and get to lategame along with a structure or two that I can play on turns 3/4. Quake can still hit this deck hard as is the case with any structure energy build. However, if you are aware enough and keep a structure or two in hand in preparation for quake you should be able to weather the storm and make a game of it. I&#39;m always extra cautious to fill up my board again after an opposing player uses their first quake because I know that against structure energy I usually wait until I have 2x quake before I use the first one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potion of Resistance (POR) also helps, but I do not use POR in anticipation for a quake as it&#39;s too hard to predict and not very useful after 1 quake already has the structure at -3 hp. Unless the structure is about to go off and it provides an advantage within the flow of the game. Rather, POR is normally used on a frontmost structure in order to protect an entire row behind it from creature attacks. Things like pother, flip, and rumble do exist, but if an opponent wants so badly to move a structure then I say go for it and use your cards/resources. Ultimately wild decks did not prove to be a very popular choice in the most recent ESL so I only used this deck once, but extensive testing indicates that the deck works as the title describes. This deck could probably be optimized a bit for general ranked play where you will face a wider variety of opponents. For instance, I think this deck would have a rough go against aggro growth or tempo order, but if you&#39;re looking to counter those annoying wild decks this is a good bet.</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":25,"c":2},{"id":27,"c":3},{"id":35,"c":2},{"id":47,"c":2},{"id":67,"c":3},{"id":70,"c":3},{"id":82,"c":3},{"id":98,"c":3},{"id":153,"c":2},{"id":160,"c":3},{"id":204,"c":3},{"id":207,"c":3},{"id":210,"c":3},{"id":226,"c":3},{"id":258,"c":3},{"id":281,"c":3},{"id":286,"c":3},{"id":288,"c":3}],"name":"ESL Lategame Wild Counter ","deleted":0,"resources":["energy"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 13, 'energy-3.jpg', NULL),

Place your units around Watchers and Rot Eaters, casually drop a Faith Chains etc.\r\nIf your opponent doesn''t pay enough attention, he will soon be left with a bunch of low-health idols.

The focus of the deck is to have a reliable start whereby the player can hopefully get two units out before finding a waking stone or wings shield.

After the 3 cost point, the deck ramp slows a little and can stay at 4 order for a while untill a vanguard or general is drawn, where it will hopefully ramp to six order. At six order, there are plenty of 3 cost cards, so a speed and 3 cost card combo should be easy to pull of.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of traditional pother and or reversal, I used flip because of it&#39;s effectiveness against structure energy and reliability. It also seemed like I had enough early cards to ignore needing a cantrip early game. This is part of the reason for not having a kabonk, the other being extra damage is now supplied by the eternal swords, and kabonk seemed too specific in it&#39;s use to be used reliably. Additionally, this left a slot open which allowed me to use both warder and pushback, instead of the traditional purify.

The deck also makes use of volitile mass effect spells to eliminate large swaths of troops in a single blow (unforseen onslaught) and unexpectedly sieze wins (culling of the flock).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Starting hand:</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-growth">&nbsp;</i>the contents of your starting hand is extremely important with this deck.

It&#39;s hard to give advice on how to build your resource pool with this deck because it&#39;s incredibly situational. There are times where you&#39;ll need to go up to 3 of a mono color because those are the cards you have in hand. Other times you&#39;ll have a mix but you always want to be striving for 2-3 growth/decay each and 2 wild. That&#39;s the top of the curve for this deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i>Early board presence is extremely important as well. This deck, by nature, is a snowball deck. If your opponent establishes extremely good early board presence then there is a good chance you&#39;ll just lose.

I&#39;ll give a quick description on why I use each card that I use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deck Overview: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of this deck (similar to Miracle Pudding) is to gain a bajillion resources, flood the board, then use all of your units to attack at once via God Hand, or Rallying + Crimson Bull/ Culling of the Flock. This deck can actually last awhile on it&#39;s own without the need of the explosion, except to Tempo decks that kill your Vaettrs and Nests before they get a chance to activate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cards:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Binding Root</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Binding root is usually sacrificed for scrolls, but can be useful to stop an enemy that is one space away from taking out your nest or is just a threat in general. Note: This is also the only good answer to Lockling Brood so it is smart to save this card if you know they are playing Gravelocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Eye of Eagle</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eye of Eagle is most useful in helping you draw a Budding Vaettr from your deck, but is just a solid card to help you draw a creature at the end of your turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: You can usually end your turn with an eye of eagle if you already control either Budding Vaettr or Budding Retreat because you will have excess mana after playing a creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Ragged Wolf</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ragged Wolf is a staple in most Growth decks and it is no different here. Solid 1/2/2 with Haste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: You can usually gain resources by playing this card on a board with 2+ Vaettrs. I&#39;ve used Ragged Wolf to gain enough resources for God Hand before!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Culling of the Flock</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culling of the Flock is a good &quot;gg&quot; card or board clear spell. You board is usually filled with rats and nogs, so sacrificing a Terrene Brute or a Great Wolf is worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Kinfolk Brave</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kinfolk Brave is another staple to Growth. It attacking every turn helps keep pressure in the early game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Kinfolk Brave is human; Budding Vatter will not give you resources for playing him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Nog Nest</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nog Nest is one of the only walls in the game I&#39;ll actually put my units in front of. Very strong card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: The nogs are summoned at the beginning of the turn, meaning Budding Vaettrs and Retreats will give you a larger pool of resources the turn the Nog Nest reaches zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>x2 Budding Retreat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budding Retreat is basically a Vatter that also gives resources to your opponent during their turn. I found that when I ran 3 I would stack the card too much and give the opponent too much advantage. You usually only capitalize off of it&#39;s affect for one or two turns.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Budding Vaettr</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budding Vaettr is one of the most important cards in this deck. This is what allows you to gain resources from playing cards. Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Burn is still a thing. Don&#39;t summon Vaettr unless you know you&#39;ll be able to &quot;go off&quot; within a few turns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Crimson Bull</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid attack increase that is usually used for board wipe after playing a Mangy Wolf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Mangy Wolf</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangy Wolf is a Pseudo-Rallying that only applies to wolves. A 2/2/3 Beast isn&#39;t too bad for the cost as well, especially when Vaettrs make it cheaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Skythorn</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skythorn is a solid structure that can be used to protect important cards such as your Budding Vaettr or a one countdown Nog Nest. It also allows you to draw an additional card on the turns you flood the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Terrene Brute</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This card is a strong wall as well as an excellent Culling of the Flock target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x Ancestral Pact</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ancestral Pact is best used after you &quot;went off,&quot; but didn&#39;t take out our opponents BIG unit. If your opponent board wipes or kills a few rats, you&#39;ll draw plenty of cards to prepare for next turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Fertile Soil</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fertile Soil is another Growth staple. Drawing three cards off of usually one Beast Rat or Nog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Rat King</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rat King is one of the most important cards to use along with the Budding Vaettr and Budding Retreat. Three units for four cost means that it&#39;ll give you the most creatures and resources when flooding the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Great Wolf</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great Wolf is an immediate threat when placed on the board as well as Relentless. Very strong Wolf synergy,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Do not be afraid to sacrifice Great Wolf for Culling of the Flock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Kinfolk Veteran</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably one of the best scrolls of the game. Use it to snipe an opponets creature or structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3x Rallying</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rallying is a key card for late game, where it will make all of your units attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Rallying DOES effect Nog Nest, but it doesn&#39;t reduce the sumoned Nogs&#39; countdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2x God Hand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GG / Board Wipe. &#39;Nuff said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all for reading and I hope you enjoy using this deck!</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":17,"c":3},{"id":89,"c":3},{"id":49,"c":3},{"id":290,"c":2},{"id":41,"c":3},{"id":378,"c":3},{"id":335,"c":2},{"id":375,"c":3},{"id":78,"c":2},{"id":44,"c":3},{"id":321,"c":2},{"id":374,"c":2},{"id":261,"c":2},{"id":29,"c":3},{"id":38,"c":3},{"id":75,"c":3},{"id":21,"c":3},{"id":215,"c":3},{"id":117,"c":2}],"name":"Miracle Growth","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'growth-1.jpg', NULL),

Normally wins at 8 - 12 resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Strategy</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deck reaches great damage and strong board presence by the late game. While its power is in the late game it needs to be able to deal with more aggressive early game decks. From round 1 you should be asking yourself &ldquo;Is this a quake game?&rdquo; This can also be phrased &quot;Will I ever be on the back foot or can I snowball to victory?&quot; This will dictate how you play the game from the subsequent turns. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you play nothing but quake but you keep in mind this is a strong possibility, so you don&rsquo;t want to overcommit 2 hp units to ensure you get the most value out of your quake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Quake game</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of things that would indicate it may or not be a quake game from the opening turns. If they are playing multiple low hp units, it&rsquo;s probably a quake game. If they are playing many structures, it&rsquo;s probably a double quake game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to keep a quake in your hand from as early as possible, if you think it&rsquo;s a quake game but you don&rsquo;t want to mulligan hoping to get a quake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Establish board presence with units with 4hp so the quake will not kill your units. Try to get the most out of your quake, this may mean you want to wait till your opponent&#39;s board fills up a little before quaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-quake you want to fill the board with a rat king or sister of the owl a great wolf or Kinfolk Veteran. Establish board presence quickly, and hopefully follow up with a God hand or rally to stay on the offensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Non Quake game</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A non-quake game is entirely possible and probably in many games. It is particularly effective versus late game Decay decks where quakes are less effective. You want to sac quake and gale and work your way up to bigger creatures, use rats or sisters of the fox to protect more powerful units and hold on to rallys as they will be very effective in the mid game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to work your way towards God Hand after you hit 5 resources. This will mean you will be card starved. Try to keep at least 3 scrolls in hand. It&rsquo;ll be all worth it when you hit the monster god hand and can win the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Draw and Ramp</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This deck relies on ramp/draw from Mystics and Vaettrs to arrive at a late game point. Always draw from the Mystics unless you can kill your oppoent&#39;s units with her, and try to get the full 2 resource ramp from the vaettr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Starting hand:</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are looking to start with Earthborn Mystic, Vaettrs, and Nog Nests. Although if you go second, and your opponent plays a turn 1, 1HP unit you should always try to get a ragged wolf to destroy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>Deck Quirks:</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why no Kinfolk Brave?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to over commit with 2 hp units and open yourself up to a big board clear with no comeback. The brave was not doing enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why only Stag Hearts?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ensures you know what you are going to draw with the mystic, and increases the reliablity of the stag hearts stacking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Sister of the Owl over Gusty Izulr?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sister has synergy with Terrene Brute by spawning 2 creatures with one scroll. Also the owl does well with stag hearts on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stag Heart</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up replacing the Inner power/Death cap with stag heart. RIP combo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why only 1 or 2 of a Scroll?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I messed around with the alot to because I was going off curve alot of the time. The one or two creatures are to try to retain a good resource curve so I can consistantly play strong scrolls each round.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Combos</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a late game deck which means it&rsquo;s unlikely you will win before hitting at least 8 resources. This opens up the gates to some interesting combos.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frost Gale-Quake</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a great way to rid yourself of 4 hp structures such as watchers or conduits, or 3 hp units like agaist tempo order.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nog Nest-rally</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rallying to proc the nog nest is a great way of speeding up the process and ensuring a value on your nog nest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rally-Crimson Bull</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2 scroll God Hand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Addition/Substitution Scrolls:</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Unleash Inner Power</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This scroll is great for removal in combination with instant damage such as gale, quake hasted creatures. It can be used both offensively or defensively. It&#39;s particularly good in dealing with Potion of Resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vaettr of the wild</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a great turn 1 play if you get to go first especially versus Decay and can win you games through the early agression it enables. This addition gives you a stronger early board presence while sacrificing board wipe value with a quake or gale.</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":49,"c":3},{"id":84,"c":2},{"id":208,"c":3},{"id":53,"c":2},{"id":292,"c":3},{"id":378,"c":3},{"id":78,"c":2},{"id":212,"c":3},{"id":302,"c":3},{"id":374,"c":2},{"id":22,"c":3},{"id":29,"c":2},{"id":215,"c":1},{"id":307,"c":3},{"id":21,"c":3},{"id":34,"c":3},{"id":75,"c":3},{"id":222,"c":2},{"id":117,"c":3},{"id":297,"c":1}],"name":"","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'growth-1.jpg', NULL),

The idea is to get out lots of creatures and maintain board control using machinated, desperation, and peircing projectile. Always try to destroy your opponents units instead of idols, but allow your creatures to gradually chip away at the idols. Then most games you will have to transition to going for idols, using corrode to win in 1-2 turns.

After board control has been established, sacrificing up to 7 resources and using Necrogeddon allows for the conversion of that board presence into a winning advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I shall explain why each card fits within the theory of this deck by turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ripper:</strong> the human aspect of this card is important for retaining board presence when used with the Ilmire Witch Doctor. All other human cards in this deck similarly are more retentive for this reason. The Ripper has relatively good stats for a 1 cost creature, and is good for establishing an early board presence in the center. I think controlling the center might be good for board control, but that&#39;s just me. This creature can be played on the middle or front rank, depending on if there is a creature with more health that can protect the Ripper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Viserca Sage:</strong> Now you might be thinking, &quot;Why would you play this card instead of Loyal Darkling?&quot;. Well to that I say, I would rather have the potential for drawing more cards than guaranteed idol damage; drawing more cards expedites the deployment of creatures onto the board due to our increased ability to sac for resources more often, or having more cards to play than we would otherwise. The threat of drawing more cards is something our opponent has to work around, thereby increasing our control of the board. So even if our opponent prevents us from drawing more cards, they must do so at the cost of board control. In order to obtain the most value from the drawing effect, this card should be played in the back rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Languid:</strong> If opposing creatures can&#39;t kill our creatures, our creatures will remain on the board longer. Some of our creatures can benefit from killing a languid afflicted creature like the Corpus Collector or Lifestealer or Viscera Sage. The languid creature just takes up space and prevents our opponent from using that space to better control the center or other contested areas of the board. The card also lets us draw while it&#39;s still our turn, allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the deployment of our creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ilmire Tribesman:</strong> The main function of this creature is a wall, which is especially important early on for protecting a Viscera Sage or Corpus Collector. The high health of this creature ensures its greater potential to remain on the board longer than alternative choices, which makes it better for our plan of establishing board presence. Since this card functions primarly as a wall, it should be played in the front rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Harvester:</strong> With the amount of board presence we&#39;re committing to, typically a lot of creatures die from either side, making the Harvester an atypically active contributor for re-establishing board control. Typically this card is played before a turn where creatures are going to die, which can be earlier skirmishes, or, more typically, later in the game when there&#39;s more creatures that can die. Since it actually takes creatures dying to attack a creature on the back rank, there&#39;s a good chance that a Harvester on the back rank may be able to attack and save itself if placed there, as compared to the potential of a Harvester on the front rank; the Harvester belong on the back rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brain Lice:</strong> Since there are many &quot;on kill&quot; effect creatures, as mentioned when describing the benefits of Languid for this deck, Brain Lice works to ease the process of activating those kill effects by slowly but surely reducing the health of pesky, annoying enemy creatures. Think of this card as greasing the wheels of the deck&#39;s plan; it&#39;s able to target creatures in the back ranks which pose a serious threat to keeping our creatures on the board, since otherwise creatures protected on the back rank would likely be able to attack many times before finally being brought to justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Soul Steal:</strong> There are a lot of 2 health creatures played in the early game, which is great for us because this card not only prevents enemy board presence but adds to our own. This card enables us to solidify our control of the board early on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ilmire Rot Eater:</strong> This creature is good for retaining board control because it benefits when our own creatures die. Typically the ability to confer benefits onto active units as opposed to creatures just dying is indicative of maintaining threats that can then be converted once again into a superior board presence. This creature should be placed on the middle rank, since it&#39;s probably surrounded by more creatures that can die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blightbearer:</strong> This card may not be able to retain itself on the board because it damages itself upon attacking, but, more importantly, it controls rows remarkably well, since any creature that destroys Blightbearer takes poison damage. This has a few implications, but to name a few, it can lower a creature&#39;s hp below 3 for a Soul Steal, or become cursed by the Cursemonger, ensuring a swift death. Blightbearer is a great card for furthering the potency of &quot;on kill&quot; effect creatures or some spells. Because of the threat of poisoning attackers that kill it, Blightbearer should be played on the front rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Infectious Blight:</strong> This enchantment limits the board presence of the enemy by slowly killing off all their creatures. It&#39;s effect can be magnified by the Cursemonger or Brain Lice. The enemy really has to work to make this card not pay for itself by killing one creature. Because our army is based on retaining its numbers, Infectious Blight is useful for winning wars of attrition, should they arise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ilmire Hunter:</strong> This card can serve as a wall, but also can serve as a way to dispatch powerful enemy creatures. Due its sheer killing power, this card solidifies board control for the middle stage of the game. Since this card has so much sway over board control, it&#39;s optimally placed in the middle rank, where it&#39;s mobility is more flexible until room for an Ilmire Witch Doctor must be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cursemonger:</strong> The fact that Cursemonger can apply a curse 2 to any creature it sees fit, and the fact that several enchantments and spells are better used with curse 2, means that Cursemonger enhances those effects for the middle to late game, and effectively deals with back rank protected creatures that could threaten board domination. Curse 2 also means that &quot;on kill&quot; effects are more accessible, making several aspects about the deck more efficient. Overall, this unit, which should occupy the back rank, offers the flexibility to regain or improve board control in many different situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Corpus Collector:</strong> This card might be the most efficient card with respect to this deck&#39;s objective; the &quot;on kill&quot; effect not only gets rid of a creature, but spawns a Husk as well. Soul Steal has a similar function, but it only works on creatures with 2 or less health, while this works on creatures with 4 or less health. Additionally, Corpus Collector continues to be active on the board after the similar effect to Soul Steal happens. Now that is what I called efficiency. Obviously prolonging this creature&#39;s existence is paramount, and so Corpus Collector should be placed on the back row.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lifestealer:</strong> When I think of creature retention, this creature stands out as one of the best examples. It&#39;s hard to gain superior board control when you have to fight a creature that can effectively have double its health if played correctly, if not more. Sometimes Lifestealer should be on the front rank and sometimes it should be repositioned until it can kill and heal itself; so, Lifestealer should ideally have access to the middle rank to be most effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oblivion Seeker:</strong> This card can either be allowed to attack or be destroyed and allow you to draw 2 cards. Harvesters, Rot Eaters, and Witch Doctors additionally benefit when Oblivion Seeker dies. The extra draws are important at this stage of the game, since around this time is when saccing up to 7 resources and trying to draw Necrogeddon is the primary objective. Oblivion Seeker should be placed in the front rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ilmire Witch Doctor:</strong> Since we&#39;ve committed so much effort to gaining board presence with human creatures, the Witch Doctor solidifies that board presence, since being hit by quake, or any mass removal will just spawn husks around the Witch Doctor. The point being that after we&#39;ve played the Witch Doctor, it&#39;s hard for our opponent to regain board control before we&#39;re able to use Necrogeddon to great effect. This creature should be placed on the middle rank ideally to be around more human creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Necrogeddon:</strong> After we&#39;ve established board control, Necrogeddon can be used to clear the board of enemy units or attack idols and win the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, the scrolls chosen for this deck accomplish the plan of the deck, and since those scrolls are so focused on board control by greater unit retention, and since other factions cannot as easily accomplish this same retention, this deck works great against less focused decks, or decks that cannot generate threats as fast, late game decks being the prime example.</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":242,"c":3},{"id":161,"c":3},{"id":181,"c":3},{"id":244,"c":3},{"id":172,"c":3},{"id":183,"c":3},{"id":190,"c":3},{"id":195,"c":3},{"id":168,"c":3},{"id":187,"c":3},{"id":196,"c":3},{"id":200,"c":3},{"id":271,"c":3},{"id":59,"c":3},{"id":194,"c":3},{"id":166,"c":3},{"id":188,"c":2}],"name":"Retention-focused Decay","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),

It has a low resource curve and no cantrip effects so sacrificing for Scrolls will often be necessary. Fortunately the most powerful combos in the deck work with six resources. Obviously the Hasted Harvester, but also Flesh Animator enchanted with Fleetness, with the exception of the Animator, Rot Eater and Effigy every scroll that goes on the board is or creates undead, this means with the Fleet Animator in play your whole board is counting down by 2 every turn and anything enchanted with shroud of unlife also counts down. &quot;But most undead have 3 countdown&quot; says a skeptical looking person, probably better at the game than I am, &quot;Restless Bones?&quot; I reply shrugging. Looking for another neat interaction, put an Anima Conduit somewhere near an Effigy of the Queen (in the deck to hard counter Quake, Thunder Surge and Sudden Eruption which would otherwise wreck it) and enjoy an endless stream of revenants. To help with ramping look for an early Tethered Recruit. An early Rot Eater is also very strong since a ton of your units will be dying around it. Try to save Revenants for when they pump Rot Eaters or tick down Harvesters, probably don&#39;t keep them in a starting hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sacrificing I usually sac up to 3<i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i>1<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i>1<i class="icon-wild">&nbsp;</i>then sac for Scrolls and sac for the final 1<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;when I have the chance this will let you play Hastevester, Fleet Animator and Anima of the Queen. Then continue saccing for scrolls and spamming the field with undead. Round Fifteen or earlier is probably when you want to be wrapping the game up, if you&#39;re losing presence Hastevester can help you get it back. This deck is by no means done, I&#39;ve only played a handful of test games with it, some against the AI, it will likely change based on the Meta. Husks will likely come out for Damning Curses, an Effigy and a Fleetness may come out and 2 Purification go in or maybe Sanctuary of the Lost instead. A Corpus collector may be replaced by another Restless Bones (Collector is another good target for Fleetness) and Irva looks very, very tempting especially since the way the card is worded it looks like she could get up to 4 attacks on a Harvester charge, she might replace Corpus Collector altogether (I love the card but dat 3 health).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, this is a draft of the deck I&#39;ll likely be playing when Waypoints goes live, and once upon a time I was a halfway decent player so you may want to have a go with it yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GL HF Fellow Scroldiers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-ExScalab3r</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":349,"c":3},{"id":179,"c":3},{"id":164,"c":3},{"id":163,"c":3},{"id":268,"c":3},{"id":350,"c":3},{"id":131,"c":3},{"id":172,"c":3},{"id":195,"c":3},{"id":190,"c":3},{"id":352,"c":3},{"id":177,"c":2},{"id":271,"c":3},{"id":353,"c":3},{"id":361,"c":3},{"id":178,"c":3},{"id":234,"c":3}],"name":"Undead Tempo","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),

Since I have released this guide I have found that I have changed out just about every card and tried just about every possible combo no matter how much I may have innitially been opposed to it. By being open to the possibility that I was wrong in some of my assumptions and to adjust to an ever shifting meta so early into this expansion I have created an MES deck that performs even better than I had hoped as I now sit in the top 15 in ranked play and hope to go even higher. I will be updating this guide soon with my current list, which I believe will fit into the longterm Waypoints meta better than what I innitially presented here. Ultimately there is not a huge difference in cards, but I would guess that at least 5-8 cards have been substitued for others that I have found to perform better overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Intro and About Me</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey guys. This is Chace from Scrolls. Member of The Fairy Princess Guild Association(FPGA). I am the reigning ESL Scrolls season champion since the Spring 2014 season and consistently in the top 100. Admitedly, before Waypoints hit I had not been playing a ton of Scrolls. But with the new expansion it&#39;s exciting to examine everything going on and try to build the best possible deck. I am currently engaged in the iterative process of doing this with Mono Energy Structures or MES. Overall, I believe this is a very strong deck for the current meta and it is also a bit different from what I&#39;ve seen other MES players running. This deckguide goes in depth about every card in the deck and why some weren&#39;t included so if you don&#39;t want to read much then turn away now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Cards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper Automaton (x2) - You can often get good trade value from Copper Auto due to it&#39;s 1 turn cooldown and massive 4 damage for 1 cost. Copper Auto is an excellent card to have in your opening hand and it&#39;s easy to play during the lategame as a removal spunge or immediate threat.&nbsp; However, it is often a dead draw during the midgame and can set you back longterm if it is removed when you could have played a valuable structure. For this reason I have only included 2 in the deck at this time, but I will run tests with 3 of them in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potion of Resistance or POR (x2) - Another 1 cost card. POR is included in the deck to ensure that your structures, divinators, etc, get to keep on doing their thing. I find this card is often much less valuable in opening hands when compared to Copper Auto. This is because you need to first have a field presence to get any value out of it. That means you are probably putting it on a 3-4 cost structure you&#39;ve just played and it can be hard to fit in a 1 mana drop early on when there are so many 3,4, and 5 drops in the deck that need to get onto the field. There are situations where it&#39;s a nice to have POR in your opening hand, but I find that I often end up saccing it. Decay is about the only faction I can think of that can somewhat easily remove a non structure unit with POR on it with Damning Curse and Soul Steal, so try to play POR on your structures when playing against Decay. Every other faction is probably going to have to wait out the 3 turn duration of POR in order to kill the unit. This card is also a very very strong play in the Energy vs Energy matchup be it the mirror match or vs Gravelocks. Basically, POR ensures that the game is going to go on longer, it&#39;s going to get to lategame, and as a MES player that plays to our advantage big time. I&#39;ve experimented running 3 in the past and I find it&#39;s just not needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overdrive (x1) - A card that can be awesome at times, but is really only useful on Ether Pump to cause 1 unexpected global damage in my oppinion. I&#39;ve also had completely devastating Overdrive + Ether Pump interactions if the opponent is unable to remove it, but this combo is not reliable enough to include more than a single Overdrive. Can be used on Clock Library and Auto Forge in a pinch as well. I only use 1 Overdrive because in the past I&#39;ve found that having 2 of these in hand at the same time and no structures in play that benefit from it can set you back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spark (x3) - Spark is a staple in just about every Energy deck ever and there&#39;s a reason why. It does 2 damage for 2 cost meaning that Spark will remove a lot of early game threats in order to help set the opponent back and get into mid and lategame. Often a terrific draw at any point in the game whether it&#39;s to destroy a unit or just bring one into kill range by some other means. I often like to have either a Spark or Burn in my opening hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automata Forge (x3) - Auto Forge is another Energy Staple because at worst it&#39;s a 5 hp wall for 3 cost. At best it spits out 3 cost automatons for free every 3 turns in addition to that. With a divinator and Forge you can often flood the field quicker than your opponent can keep up. A terrific play against just about any faction or decktype. One protip I have for Forge is that I often see other MES players putting down 2 forges in the mirror matchup. I usually try to avoid playing 2 at the same time because no matter how far one side is ahead, in the mirror MES matchup your opponent is always going to have Board clears in the form of Thunder Surge and Sudden Erruption. For this reason I do not want to have a large field of connected units and set myself up for counter value plays or put my more important structures in range of being cleared entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charge Coil (x3) - Charge Coil is a neat structure because it attacks the very next turn after you play it. This allows you to often get improved value out of your removal spells like Spark, Burn, and VD. Can be a risky play in the mirror matchup due to Burn and the fact that a single 1 damage isn&#39;t usually a big deal to MES players. Also has relatively low hp so it often needs to be tucked behind another structure. Combos effectively with ether pump and can often make it hard to near impossible for your opponent to rebuild their board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HellSpitter Mortar (x2) - Everyone&#39;s favorite card that you think sucks until it snipes an important creature because you allowed Mortar to stay around too long. However, I always view it as a bonus when my Mortar hits something. The reason I play Mortar is because it&#39;s a huge 6hp wall for just 3 cost that often requires 2 opponent attacks to be wasted on it before it&#39;ll be destroyed, which is terrific. This allows you to play Mortar up front and tuck other structures that are quite frankly more important in the back. I&#39;ve run 3 of these in the past, but since Waypoints I&#39;ve been playing with just 2 and I think I like it that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine Divinator (x3) - Is a good card if you play MES because reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Power Trip (x3) - The best &quot;new&quot; card for MES. It came out during the Rebellion Expansion, was very OP with midrange Bombard combo craziness and was subsequently nerfed into oblivion by taking out the card draw. Now that the card draw mechanic is back I have found this card to be very strong for MES where it&#39;s easy to get to 8 resources, play Power Trip and draw a card. I also have no problem using this new Power Trip early on in the game if it means I can pull off 2 moves whether that&#39;s playing 2 structures or playing a structure and removing something, etc. It&#39;s a nice niche card for MES now and I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t seen it more in MES decks.&nbsp; THIS CARD DOESN&#39;T SUCK ANYMORE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skull Shrine (x2) - This can be a tricky card to use playing as MES. Often there is no point to playing it on turn 3 if you have it in your opening hand. I think the midgame is where this card really shines as it can allow you to play 2 cards in a turn and outpace your opponent. Less useful in the lategame, which is why I have only included 2 here. I just like Powertrip better for the role of increasing resources, but it&#39;s a good card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burn (x3) - Is awesome. Does 3 damage and draws you a card. It kills a lot of stuff and it&#39;s just a terrific card. Always a good draw. I often like to have either a Burn or Spark in my opening hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clock Library (x3) - I love Clock Library and I feel like for whatever reason I value it more than most. I see a lot of MES players putting Clock Librarys up front to block. I can see why afterall it is a bulky 5 hp wall, but in my mind for 4 cost I want to get something out of this card more than it just being a wall. It doesn&#39;t hurt that if this thing does proc you get 3 cards, which is always always awesome. This allows you to continue saccing cards for resources, maintain card advantage, fish out your removal cards and get into the lategame. Now that I just typed that all out, I guess it&#39;s easy to see why I value Clock Library so much in this deck. Can be a bummer when it&#39;s about to proc and then gets removed. Clock Library also needs a long 4 turns before it will go off. Often a good candidate for Potion of Resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ether Pump (x3) - Is annoying as hell when you have a Divinator out with it. Divinator + Ether Pump is love. Even without a Divinator this card is always a big threat so prepare for your opponent to try and destroy it before it goes off multiple times. I usually like to tuck this guy behind something to try and ensure it proc&#39;s at least 1 time. Probably the best structure in the deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solemn Giant (x3) - Long a staple of MES decks so too is Solemn Giant in my build. I usually only play Solemn Giant if I can haste it and get immediate value so that means being at 10 resources or playing Power Trip to get there. At 4 hp it can be realy annoying for the opponent to remove as well and it kills just about everything in the game. This card synergizes so well with the overall theme of MES, which is to get into lategame and destroy your opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sudden Erruption (x3) - I&#39;ve long contended that Sudden Erruption + Thunder Surge is not a fair combo with the way these cards work together. But hey, nobody has listened so now I&#39;m here to abuse the combo and show you why it&#39;s so strong. Sudden Erruption even on it&#39;s own is just a great card once you get to about 7 resources. I like having 3 of these because it&#39;s now easier than ever to get to lategame as MES. Is a completely dead draw during much of the early part of the game, but you probably know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironclad Reaver (x2) - For so long I&#39;ve only run with a single Reaver in my MES deck. It&#39;s often a great card but the 5 cost can be offputting in a deck that&#39;s more focused around structures. Well, since Waypoints I&#39;ve been able to run 2 quite successfully and that makes me happy. Is a card that can give you some good options with it&#39;s ability and is also pretty hard to kill at 5 hp and also strong at 4 atk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine Chant (x3) - It&#39;s removal and it permanently increases your energy AND it gets more powerful if you have a lot of structures on the field. It&#39;s pretty much that simple and it&#39;s pretty much a terrific card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thunder Surge (x3) - The evil twin brother of Sudden Erruption. Thunder Surge is a potentially devastating card in MES that is also nicely costed for us at 6. It just works really really well with everything I&#39;ve already mentioned that MES decks are trying to accomplish. This is a card I will use in all sorts of situations. Sometimes it&#39;s to bring units in range of and ether pump or coil about to go off. Rarely I will use the card to deal 2 damage to a single unit if I feel it&#39;s worth it and don&#39;t have much else to play. Always a good card to hold onto if your opponent has a lot of cards in hand and it&#39;s starting to get into lategame. Curiously, it seems that since Waypoints I am saccing Thunder Surge a bit more than before, but this is just anecdotal evidence so I&#39;m gonna keep running 3 until I see something wrong with that. Having 6 total Sudden Erruptions + Thunder Surges means that I will very reliably have several of these cards within a turn or two of eachother, which makes clearing the opponents board easier to accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violent Dispersal (x3) - Before Waypoints I was starting to experiment with just 2x VD, but now that it&#39;s easier to get into lategame as MES I am running 3. Kills just about anything in the game, so it&#39;s got that going for it. A very good card to hold onto if you can afford to do so in order to remove an expensive opponent unit to get good value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chace, why didn&#39;t you include <em>this </em>card, YOU IDIOT!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Useless Contraption - I like Useless Contraption. I was one of the few using 3 of them right after rebellion came out before people realized they were not in fact completely useless. I just feel like as power creep continues in Scrolls it&#39;s hard to justify having something present in the deck that literally does nothing except act as a middle of the pack wall. Useless contraption just started feeling a whole lot more useless after Waypoints came out. Was at times a nice card when the situation warranted it or to increase the damage of Machine Chant, but I think Useless Contraption is probably gone for good from my MES deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hired Smuggler - Awesome when it works and shitty when it doesn&#39;t pretty much sums up this card. At 2 hp and 2 atk in a deck already filled with structures I just felt like the value isn&#39;t quit there. There&#39;s a lot of counters to a 2/2/2 card and I just thought it was time to move on. I think Smuggler will continue to be used by some other MES players, but I was already moving away from it in my MES deck before Waypoints and I don&#39;t think it has a place in my style of MES play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gravelocks - I think there may be some potential to flesh out some sort of hybrid structures deck with a Gravelock Elder and 1-2 other Gravelock sets included. I&#39;m just not interested in taking my deck in that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron Whip - I find that it&#39;s just not useful enough in my MES deck. It can be nice to proc a Clock Library or Ether Pump when it otherwise may have been destroyed, but to me there&#39;s not much different in waiting a single turn longer for a structure to go off. Can be used offensively but at just 1 damage I think that&#39;s not usually a good value play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plating - When they buffed this card I thought it might get better. It didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t like this card at all as MES because I think it&#39;s outclassed in every single way by Potion of Resistance. I only mention Plating because I see a decent amount of MES decks that run it and I do not agree with this. I think the wording and bonus ability of the card is perhaps a bit decieving to those who are less aware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proximity Mines - I am beyond ecstatic that this is no longer a needed card for MES players. Before Waypoints and due to the aggro meta Prox Mines were 100% necessary to play MES competitively, which I felt was a shame because it&#39;s really a shitty card imo. About the only cool thing with Prox Mines is that it does give you 2 structures with which to buff Machine Chant. But Proximity Mines are totally reactive and are often very easy for the opponent to react to since they are only 1 hp. Did I mention how happy I am that this card is no longer needed in MES?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In closing, MES is about 3 things in my oppinion. (1)Removal, (2)Getting into Lategame (3)Getting good value out of the decisons that you make. The first 2 here are pretty easy to figure out, but number 3 is a bit more nuanced and it can take time to develop these skills. Generally try to have a Spark or Burn in your opening hand in addition to a 3 cost structure. Try to sac for resources early and often throughout the match if you can. I try to get to 5 energy ASAP so I have the option to sac for resources and use Violent Dispersal if I draw one and can get a good value out of it. This deck has so much removal, many high HP structures, and several cards that boost up your resources so it&#39;s usually always going to get you to lategame. In my experience the deck will reliably get you to the point where the match will come down to whether or not your opponent can destroy you before you take over at around the 10 resource mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This concludes Chace&#39;s Energy Structures guide.

The amount of cantrips allows me to slowly ramp up to around 7 resource so i can do more multiple things each turn, but after that it will fall off as you got no real late game cards.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWarding Stone is great for specific situations and not so much in others, they are never really bad but can often be not what you need, so it aint out of question to switch them, i would suggest getting captain for the extra movement as the deck is heavy on soldiers, or scholar to keep that card draw power in there. Partisan is also a option but he aint to great in this deck as you will get a board presence rather fast and keep on reinforcing it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKabonk is also up for switch, it is quite useful but depending on meta so can something like purification or even pushback be more useful.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEternal sword works great in this meta, and it really helps to make sure your units start to snowball, but if meta change then i would recommend switching it. The meta it aint good against is MER heavy and Order heavy meta, as MER will often find ways to remove the sword, mostly by storm runner, and Order has many ways such as displacement scrolls and purification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEffigy can also be a bit of a meta card, depending on how things change so can Wings Warder be more useful.

Note that I am more of a Growth player and I have not adopted to this deck as of yet however players such as Lahopaa and Ghost_Bomb managed to show that this type of deck is very effective in the current meta by getting 1st and 2nd place in the Waypoint Tournament with their own versions of this deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deck basically counters Aggrowth and Tempo Order to the point where they are forced to rush idols or they lose in the mid-late game even if you have idols with 1hp. With the current meta Aggrowth and Tempo Order are seen very often and you can be sure to play against them a lot in the ranked play making Energy Control decks highly effective to counter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deck is not known for having many creatures so this is a down side and you are bound to lose early however after the early aggression you can stall the game and win with deadly combos such as Oculus Cannon + Overdrive and other similar huge combos. Aggrowth and Tempo Order will always struggle with finishing games against this deck type so you shouldn&#39;t worry if you lose early game as you are bound to come back later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said before, this deck is somewhat a hybrid of MER decks as it uses very similar scrolls but does not have enough ranged units to be called MER therefore it&#39;s more of a Energy Control deck. Also this deck is quite new to the meta therefore everyone runs their own versions of it and scrolls vary from deck to deck and it would be cool if everyone else could post their own versions of this deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s it from me and good luck in ranked play with this deck!</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":205,"c":3},{"id":47,"c":3},{"id":96,"c":3},{"id":281,"c":3},{"id":235,"c":3},{"id":140,"c":3},{"id":207,"c":3},{"id":152,"c":3},{"id":256,"c":3},{"id":77,"c":3},{"id":322,"c":3},{"id":223,"c":3},{"id":27,"c":3},{"id":284,"c":3},{"id":286,"c":3},{"id":25,"c":2},{"id":70,"c":3}],"name":"New Meta Energy Control Decks","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'energy-4.jpg', NULL),

This deck is fairly straight forward: Throw down some creatures, buff said creatures, kill 2 idols, rumble, kill 1 more idol, profit. If your opponent tries to poison you, spit a vitality well in his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have to keep enchanted units protected behind weaker, punier units. And in most cases it is wise to split your enchantments such as stag hearts over a number of creatures so in the unlikely event that they manage to take out a big unit, all is not lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Starting hand:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are looking to start with Earthborn Mystic, Vaettrs, Braves and Stag Hearts.

It used to deal 1 damage to each of your idols when you played a lingering spell (applied to you and your opponent). This wasn&#39;t that great, since it deterred opponent lingering spells, but did not help you deal direct idol damage.&nbsp; They could just opt not to play lingering spells, and then your are restricted from playing the spells that you really need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it is beautiful. Whenever anyone plays a lingering spell, it mills an opponent idol for 2.&nbsp; With this change, I think there is now enough indiscriminate idol damage to mill an opponent down to zero (see video).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i><strong>Pillar of Fatigue</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This gives you a persistent way to stall their board. In the games I played, I always ended up completely ignoring the middle three rows, playing only on the top and bottom rows.&nbsp; With pillar of fatigue, they have to give up attacks to take out your units. The other stall is great (Draining mist and Sickening Fumes), but those only prevent one wave of attacks each. I thnk I only won the games I did because of the cost this scroll put on moving their armies out of the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i><strong>Draining Mist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all the idol damage scrolls needed in this deck, you can&#39;t afford to actually put in enough scrolls to even try for board control . This is a very card-efficient way to make them lose attacks, and the fact that it leaves their board alive is no problem! Blockers are meaningless against this deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i><strong>Sickening Fumes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could have 6 of these, I would. As above, it makes them effectively lose their attacks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Cards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i><em>Blightbearer</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This helps give something worth playing on the way to 6 resources. It also combos nicely with pillar of fatigue. If you put it in front of their units, they have to choose between poisoning themselves or moving out of the way (increasing the countdown via pillar of fatigue).&nbsp; At which point you move in front of them again.&nbsp; If they keep moving, you win, because you stalled without using cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i><em>Languid</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gives you card draw (which will be lacking if you can&#39;t get pillar/scryer going) and nullifies a creature.&nbsp; The card draw is the main reason I have this and not soul steal for early stall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-decay">&nbsp;</i><em>Rattle Hymn</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I almost consider this a core card because it tutors for lingering spells.&nbsp; Invocation sentries have been my main source of damage so far in testing, and this is more fuel for the fire. If it takes out Halls, all the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How is it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It fared well against tempo order and necrogeddon decay, but I think that was almost entirely down to the fact that they didn&#39;t understand what I was doing until their idols were critically low.&nbsp; I suspect quake, burn, and mango speed combos are going to be ruinous for this deck, so clearly you have to wrap it up by mid-game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a work in progress, but I think it has potential.&nbsp; One opponent nearly killed himself with necrogeddon on video!&nbsp; I&#39;m not so sure I need hex marks, but I&#39;m not sure what I would put in to replace it.</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":192,"c":3},{"id":162,"c":3},{"id":345,"c":3},{"id":244,"c":2},{"id":362,"c":3},{"id":202,"c":3},{"id":267,"c":3},{"id":255,"c":3},{"id":168,"c":3},{"id":250,"c":3},{"id":186,"c":3},{"id":184,"c":3},{"id":183,"c":3},{"id":540,"c":3},{"id":181,"c":3},{"id":239,"c":3},{"id":344,"c":3}],"name":"Idol hate","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),

Their movement effect can be tricky to master with Revenants on the field. Remember attack order at all times. Revenants will disappear after they attack, leaving a possible hole in your formation that you didn&#39;t predict. &nbsp;Now your shambler moves there, and your plans are all off. &nbsp;Pay attention to your shamblers - and try keeping them in either the back or the front row, where it is easier to manipulate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">As for Soul Steal, it&#39;s yet another way for you to take advantage of Soul Scrounger, and is just an all around good value scroll even without it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;"><strong>Revenant:&nbsp;</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">There is pretty much only one use for this guy, and it&#39;s playing him with Restless Bones. You can get away with playing him behind a Rot Eater sometimes, but these guys are pretty much used as surprise four damage that goes well with an Irva, Rot Eater, or Harvester on field. &nbsp;Good for finishing games or clearing rows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;"><strong>Slayer Vestige&nbsp;</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">This guy can do work. &nbsp;Be careful playing him on turn 2. &nbsp;Make sure you have a plan for what to do if your opponent is able to attack into him before his cooldown is up. &nbsp;For example, having a Languid in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Scrolls that can probably be swapped out:</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;"><strong>Soul Scrounger:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">Yes, Soul Scrounger. &nbsp;You have to be careful with this one. &nbsp;At its new 2 cost, I find it much more playable. &nbsp;Almost every time, it should be played on a Harvester, or in some cases a Rot Eater. &nbsp;Don&#39;t play it on a unit unless you are making something die that same turn which triggers the Soul Scrounged unit. &nbsp;Otherwise, it&#39;s easy to lose value with this card. &nbsp;Played correctly, you can really surprise your opponent and then basically have a Fleetness&#39;d unit out on the field. &nbsp;Pretty fun stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;"><strong>Unbind</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">Yes, Unbind. &nbsp;While this may be a scroll you want to swap out, I&#39;ve found lots of utility with it in the current meta. &nbsp;Potions of resistance are everywhere, as are enchanted growth creatures. &nbsp;This can shut that type of play down very quickly. &nbsp;Otherwise, just sacrifice it. &nbsp;I almost always save these vs Energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;"><strong>Shroud of Unlife</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">This card works great with the &quot;It&#39;s ok if my units die&quot; philosophy of this deck. &nbsp;Not only does it help with blocking rot eaters, it&#39;s great for hasting Flesh Animators or Rot Eaters with Restless Bones. &nbsp;Good stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;"><strong>Cursed Presence:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20.8000011444092px;">This is more of a removal tool. &nbsp;A lot of times, opponents tend to underestimate a Darkling presence on the field. &nbsp;Surprise, he does 4 damage. &nbsp;Combined with Brain lice, it&#39;s often a 5 cost removal in one turn.

The bonus is that Cleaver is playable once you have dominion!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Wings Warder</strong> x2<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Good protection from direct disruption during all phases of the game. 4hp for 2 cost is nothing to sneeze at either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Advantageous Outlook</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try to only use this when it will be useful to buff your Arbys. NOTE: sometimes you will find yourself in a situation where you can play it and nothing else&hellip; play it. Getting your deck rolling is worth the waste of the attack buff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Righteous Partisan</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use only for the draw, aka when you would have equal or less creatures than your opponent. 3hp makes for a decent blocker for your Arbys, but it is not ideal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Speed</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Makes your Arbys super threatening. Do not hesitate to use it on other things early in the game as long as you kill the thing that you attack. in the late game it works on Cleavers too. REMINDER: You cannot play speed on a just played Arby to make it attack, you must also have another spell cast. If you have to sac a Speed or Tempo Theft, sac the Speed (usually).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Tempo Theft</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This better than Speed in 80% of all cases. Your opponent will get the clue that at some point you want to have instant Arby attacks and space out their units to avoid the blast. However you can target a 1cdr unit outside of your attack to effectively remove the threat of another unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Waking Stones</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use these as your walls. NEVER sac these early, or really any time in the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Warding Stone</strong> x1<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is your secondary wall, use this if you need to remove a buffed unit, or threaten to remove it. Waking stones is better 90% of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Wings Sorceress</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Decent attacker and use the active to remove poison and languid mostly. Also use the active against growth enchantments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Gallant Defender</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is your secondary wall and attacker. You will most likely have fewer units than your opponent, so its armor should be in affect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Pushback</strong> x2<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use to remove a high cost/health unit to make for ideal Arby blasts. Use also to remove enchants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Arbalestier</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is where 90% of your damage will come from. Position it wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Wings Cleaver</strong> x2<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sac these every time until you have dominion. Keep in mind that you only have 2 of them, so if you play Royal Inspiration with them both in in hand (or in play) then you will not draw the other one. To solve this, sac the one you will then draw with Royal Inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i><strong> Imperial Resources</strong> x3<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use this as soon as you can, and then after the first one use it to save Waking Stones and to heal off poison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8<i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i> <strong>Cay, Royal Envoy</strong> x1<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She is a monster with dominion and provides unparalleled draw support. Try to play her when you are going to kill something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":52,"c":3},{"id":71,"c":3},{"id":95,"c":3},{"id":105,"c":3},{"id":359,"c":3},{"id":55,"c":3},{"id":61,"c":3},{"id":384,"c":3},{"id":178,"c":3},{"id":308,"c":3},{"id":315,"c":1},{"id":360,"c":3},{"id":48,"c":2},{"id":280,"c":3},{"id":306,"c":2},{"id":357,"c":3},{"id":157,"c":3},{"id":314,"c":1},{"id":298,"c":2}],"name":"","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'order-2.jpg', NULL),

You&#39;re looking to take control of the board early and never let it go. You&#39;re aiming to drop a 6+ cost threat on turns 3-6 and let it do the work to keep you ahead and inching ever-closer to victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Mulligans</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Using the Mulligan feature is absolutely necessary for more consistent victories. A bad hand will have you too far behind in tempo before you can really get going. A great starting hand contains:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>One or more &quot;ramp&quot; spells from the following list (in order of priority):</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Skull Shrine</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Power Trip</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Fulmination Conduit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1-2 Threats (in order of priority):</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Cannon Automaton or&nbsp;<i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Top Reaver Thea</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Solemn Giant</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Iron Ogre&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">I&#39;m not really sure on the orderings between the pairs, but I&#39;ve definitely found Cannon/Thea to be better opening draws than the Ogre or the Giant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Individual Scroll highlights</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In which I gush about some very key cards and their special cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Skull Shrine</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Goodness is this card amazing. Playing this on turn 3 lets your turns 4-6 become:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turn 4:</strong> Cannon Automaton / Violent Dispersal / Thunder Surge / Solemn Giant + Tick once</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turn 5:</strong> Iron Ogre</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turn 6:</strong> Top Reaver Thea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the game it&#39;s often thrown away, but it can also be a great filler card to make sure you&#39;re using all your Energy now and giving you more for later, especially in conjunction with a Tempest Reaver</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Tempest Reaver</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rarely if ever what you want to see early on. If you&#39;re falling behind they make &quot;cheap&quot;, resilient blockers in front of your more powerful threats. Later in the game they allow you a chance to split; dropping a Tempest Reaver on the opposite side of the board can be awkward to defend when it can potentially snipe a full-health idol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><i class="icon-order">&nbsp;</i>Blessing of Haste,&nbsp;<i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Fury,&nbsp;<i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Iron Whip</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These cards have been a more recent addition and they&#39;re doing some amazing work. They help screw up combat timing and letting you sneak victories before they&#39;re put out of reach. Iron Whip in particular is notable for helping Thea hit a new breakpoint to deal 8/4/2, which is often the difference between a full clear of a row or leaving one up in the back/middle. These sneaky tricks can often flood your hand when you don&#39;t want them (Blessing in particular, needing another card to sacrifice for often little gain) but they&#39;re a nice tool to help put yourself over the edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Notably Notorious</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In which we talk about cards that might seem great at first but haven&#39;t held up so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Solemn Giant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I really like this card in a lot of other decks. He&#39;s a versatile finisher in many slow and steady decks. When you&#39;re trying to get going quickly, however, it&#39;s usually among my least favorite cards. Often it&#39;s just going be the same as Violent Dispersal each turn without spending a card, but more often you&#39;ll be doing that in to creatures you just don&#39;t care about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you manage to sneak him well ahead of the curve, he&#39;s great. He&#39;s still great for when games do eventually get stalled. He&#39;s just not that great in an ideal curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><i class="icon-energy">&nbsp;</i>Automata Forge</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I started playing with this deck by adding everything that ramped and everything that got better with more Energy than I&#39;d know what to do with. A lot of the other cards that were Energy sinks left quickly because they weren&#39;t all that fantastic. This one&#39;s stuck around, being good enough at eating damage to stick around.

It does well in mirror matches against other LGO decks. Besides that, it shares pretty much the same weaknesses and strengths of other LGO decks: vs Growth, if you Kabonk the Vaettr or Aging Knight + BoH (Blessing of Haste) kill the Kinfolk Brave, you have pretty good chances to win, otherwise, meh. Decay and Order Tempo decks might also outplay you early on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong> The core concept for the unfamiliar is to ramp up quickly in order to enable insane late game plays relatively early, that&#39;s why there are alot of cantrips (spells which among other functions let you draw cards). Cast heritage on either important units you anticipate will die or weak blockers to keep up. Losing your board is entirely possible and even likely, your job is to eliminate core threats or increase cooldown of big damage dealers to protect your creatures and idols.<br />\r\nIn your starting hand, you will want to have some cantrips and Aging Knight or Righteous Partisan. Especially vs Growth, having a Kabonk or an Aging Knight + BoH can be so important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are certain combos which will bring you back into the game, and for these, you need to collect the right cards while splitting and cantripping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangonels, Reloras and Arbalestier are your most important tools for any of the following combos, so try to keep them until you can play them. Especially Reloras, he&#39;s only 2x in this deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All those combos mentioned are ones you can play straight out of your hand, which is what you want to do vs decay and energy decks, since those will just damning curse or violent dispersal your Arbalestier / Reloras, and Spark/Burn/Erode your Mangonels. Also, more often than not, your opponent will control the board, so not playing right out of your hand will often result in your important stuff getting killed which results in a big value and tempo loss. But in case you got a Reloras out when doing any of these combos, make sure you position reloras adjacent to attacking stuff to make them profit from his attack buff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2 resources:</strong> Aging Knight + Blessing of Haste: Mostly used vs Vengeful Vaettr, Kinfolk Brave and Hired Smuggler. These are big threats worth spending two cards for removing them. Even later in the game, keeping both Aging Knight and BoH in your hand might be a good idea because those are unexpected 2 damage (even more with Reloras buff).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6 resources: Mangonel + Speed:</strong> Many players will see this coming and split their board accordingly so you can&#39;t kill more than two creatues. Surprisingly often though, players will forget to do that or not see it coming and then this combo might be a game changer. DON&#39;T do it if you don&#39;t get much value out of it or if you&#39;re not really hard pressed to kill some damage dealing stuff. You can bait the opponent into cramping up his creatures by making him feel safe and good positioning of your own units. Sometimes, when you don&#39;t do this combo once you reach 6 resource, opponents will feel safe and drop their guard. Use that opportunity next turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8 resources: Mangonel + Speed + Flip:</strong> This one you will very rarely get to play, but once you do, you can do an unexpected board clear vs an opponent who did split up his board well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9 resources:</strong> Once you reach 9 resources, you really start to get going. The most powerful combos become possible at this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mangonel + Speed + Mangonel: </strong>Don&#39;t forget to cast speed on the first Mangonel before dropping the second one in it&#39;s proper place, or you will hate yourself for the next 30 minutes. You can cover 8 tiles with 3 damage doing this combo, or by overlapping the AoE, 6 damage on two tiles. The opponent&#39;s most important stuff should be gone once you&#39;re done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arbalestier + Tempo Theft:</strong> This does not always make sense, so don&#39;t forget to make sure you get decent value out of this. Keep in mind damage dealt to the creatures gets halfed and rounded down. So without buffs, 5 damage to first, 2 damage to 2nd, 1 damage to 3rd creature on the lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10 resources: Reloras + Mangonel + Speed:</strong> This allows you to deal 4 damage to 4 tiles in the AoE. Not the most cost efficient combo, but very often, this is exactly what you need, since at that point in time, many 4 health units important to your opponent will cover the board. Also, this one is less expected and prepared against than the 6 resource Mangonel + Speed drop, so this combo might deal very ugly damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From that point on, the possibilities to do harm right out of your hand open up greatly and it&#39;s up to you and your imagination how to clear the board and kill idols. Never overreach, always keep some scrolls for the following turns, except when you have to deal with attacking stuff from your opponent that might wipe you.</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":64,"c":3},{"id":105,"c":2},{"id":232,"c":3},{"id":36,"c":2},{"id":50,"c":3},{"id":62,"c":2},{"id":121,"c":2},{"id":55,"c":3},{"id":92,"c":2},{"id":384,"c":2},{"id":155,"c":3},{"id":178,"c":2},{"id":308,"c":3},{"id":312,"c":2},{"id":48,"c":2},{"id":280,"c":3},{"id":354,"c":2},{"id":74,"c":2},{"id":357,"c":3},{"id":157,"c":3},{"id":314,"c":1}],"name":"","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'order-3.jpg', NULL),

But there comes the tricky part:move irva to a location where your idols are at low health, then cast monstrous brood on one typ of wolf you have many of on the field, they will all convert to monstrocities which are all bunched up together giving each other +1 attack. Then cast essence feast when the have the countdown of 0: Healing almost all your idols by at least 1(max:3) and giving your monstrocities double attack for the turn dealing a minimum of 7 damage on each row the monstrocities are on.

Good thing: the deck have both Eye of Eagle, Somata Shift and not a lot of other creatures, so it shouldn&#39;t be that of a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">If you have only one Mystic, you&#39;d want to protect her at any cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Vengeance Veil:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The second part of the combo. Guess what would happen when you trigger the &ldquo;Draw Enchantment&rdquo; on Mystic that heve Veil on her? Yep. You can draw as many scrolls as Mystic has health. And after you&#39;d draw all those cards, you still woul be able to attack this round. Cool, huh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">You&#39;d want to start with Veil in your hand, so it would be ok to mulligan in an attempt to get this even if you&#39;d lose a Mystic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">As Veil have replenish, it plays nicely with a lot of other enchantments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Bloodboil:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The third part of the combo. When a Mystic with the Bloodboil draws an enchantment, she gets +2 attack. Along with Veil and a lot of health you could ramp up the attack to the redicolous heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Also, the Bloodboil is very important as it have replenish and is of the main deck&#39;s color &mdash; growth. If you would have both it and Veil in a starting hand, you would want to save them, as this would allow you not to sacrifice for order, but just cast Bloodboil and then Veil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Machination Mindset:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The last part of the combo. When you would have a lot of attack on Mystic, it would be useless without the relentless. This enchantment provides exactly that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">It can be sometimes not that easy to cast it, as the Energy is the third resource you&#39;d like to sacrifuce for, but it is ok to cast it later than sooner and other enchantments with replenish would make it easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong style="outline-width: 0px; font-family: sFont !important;">Other Key Scrolls</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Verdant Veil:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Verdant Veil provides much needed health (to draw more scorlls) and Ward, as you&#39;d like to keep your baffed Mystic active board at all costs.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">This is rather important versus some match-ups, so you&#39;d like to have on in a starting hand.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Potion of Resistance:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">While Veil provides defence from bad spells and enchantments, you still would want to protect it from direct combat damage. Potion of Resistance does just that, and if the combo had already triggered, then those three round would be just enough to destroy three idols using your enormous relentless attacks.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Hymn:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Hymn gives you a rather nice option to draw enchantments from your Mystic until it would have only one health, then restore it to the maximum.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Leeching Ring:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">When you&#39;d have relentless from the Machination Mindset, the Leeching Ring would often heal your mystic a lot, so you could draw even more cards.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Eye of Eagle:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">You&#39;d want to draw Mystic if you don&#39;t have one. There are other creatures in the deck, but Eye still would get you Mystic with a great chance.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Somata Shift:</strong><i class="icon-coin">&nbsp;</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Not as good as Eye for this deck, but more chances of getting Mystic are always good, even if she would have only two health from the start. You always could ramp up it for more using your enchantments.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">\r\n<h2><strong style="outline-width: 0px; font-family: sFont !important;">Really Helpful Scrolls, but not key ones</strong></h2>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Those are playing nicely with the other key scrolls, making combos better and deadlier.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>Oak Blood:</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The more health your Mystic has, the more enchantments you could draw and the less are the chances someone would kill her.

Not at the start of the game, but later she could be rather useful. There is even a chance to snap an idol if you&#39;d have an extra Vengeance Veil and Frost Gale in your hand, and a Mystic with a lot of enchantments on her somewhere.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">\r\n<h2 style="outline-width: 0px; line-height: normal;"><strong style="outline-width: 0px; font-family: sFont !important;">Scrolls that can probably be swapped out</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of those scrolls are there to keep you from losing your Mystic or idols until you&#39;ll trigger the combo. I guess there are a lot of possible variants of this deck, where those scrolls could be swapped for some other, making new combos or helping existing key scrolls in some ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kinfolk Brave:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asks your opponents to use their removals on them, protects Mystics, does some initial damage to idols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases could be a treat on himself, when buffed, but you always should place them in front of Mystics, as Mystics are VIP there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rat King:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only purpose of it is to protect your Mystic or idols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nog Nest:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same as Rat King, provides nice protection that can take a few hits and then, maybe, burst out with more protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earthen Mirth:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just one, just in case. Good for Braves, good for Mystic if in some strange occasion you wouldn&#39;t have Bloodboil, or just extra four damage for rats or nogs, if you&#39;d need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Druid Burial Ground:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protection and extra health regen for Mystics if you wouldn&#39;t have any other healing stuff for some reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vitality Well:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the same stuff: extra protection, extra health. Nice after Frost Gale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like how this deck plays, other than the key combo, there are a lot of scrolls that interact in nice ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things I noticed while playing this deck is that you should draw cards to the maximum from the Mystic, but not until she loses the ward from the Verdant Veil, or becomes too beaten up. This is because the less enchantments are there left in the deck, the more other useful stuff you would get to protect your Mystic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, don&#39;t stop on one mystic: keep the second Bloodboil and Vengeance Veil, so you could then spawn a second one and make her as powerful as the first one. This is just a matter of a one or two rounds, so if your opponent would somehow manage to kill your first baffed up Mystic, there are great chances to redo the combo using those enchantments you have saved in your hand.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":104,"c":3},{"id":41,"c":3},{"id":148,"c":3},{"id":378,"c":2},{"id":89,"c":3},{"id":213,"c":2},{"id":294,"c":3},{"id":18,"c":3},{"id":43,"c":3},{"id":34,"c":2},{"id":97,"c":3},{"id":47,"c":2},{"id":377,"c":3},{"id":370,"c":1},{"id":234,"c":2},{"id":302,"c":3},{"id":33,"c":2},{"id":376,"c":1},{"id":215,"c":2},{"id":84,"c":2},{"id":63,"c":2}],"name":"Boss Mystic","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),

Use rippers to attack medium threats and block low damage creatures, while rats hide behind them. &nbsp;Ilmire tribesmen are body blockers too. Use poisenous rats to bite from behind the wall of creatures. Try to get a creature amped up with pestis or uneasy alliance if you need that extra bite. Prefferably those cards are for the scryer, who can attack every turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2: Use poisenous cards like brainlice, rats and miasma wells to wittle down the opponents. &nbsp;Hope they don&#39;t have heals. Try to build up your resources, creatures and draw. idealy you&#39;re looking to transition with a scryer with blightseed with an illmire or boghound bodyblocking for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3: Put a scavenger construct down, animovore it. Put weenies around it to get your carddraw going. (really any creature will do, but try to keep your scryers alive behind the structure or in hand). Keep holding on, with your creatures dying for more cards, with you trying to build up resources, using spells and attacks vs the most dangerous constructs. You want to go into a carddrawing frenzy with scryer and blightseed at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4: Creature / Scryer with uneasy alliance + Morbid curiosity with blightseed nearby. Protect your blightseeded target, try to ramp us as quickly from it as you can into a steady stream of cardraw and resources for the spells you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5:It&#39;s hard to describe, there&#39;s no real starting hand for this, it&#39;s all based on luck of the draw. Every card at the right time. Opponent has little boardclear and creatures, allowing you to build up a few creatures, maybe an animovored flesh construct and an early scryer + blightseed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ways to take down your opponents idols</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arhart constanly beating down on front row enemies, hurting the idols (this is if the opponent turtles very heavily and you can&#39;t clear the board)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You turteling around an animovored flesh construct + totem of suffering protected or out of focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct damage, Pestus is one heck of an upgrade on a scryer when there&#39;s a few rats out. More rats, more damage and attacks every turn!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Necrogeddon + Rats. Get them rats, gets lots of them, unleash necrogeddon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to be more cheesy than that? Necrogeddon + rats + totems of suffering (+Necrogeddon + Monnstrous brood) If you absolutely want their idols gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weakness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your biggest weakness are buildings. You can&#39;t poison them, you can&#39;t Slay them with unforseen onslaught, and if you don&#39;t have buffs (+rats for pestis) on your scryers, you&#39;ll have a hard time getting through those.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Card explanation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Junkyard</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In there to beef up your rats if you see fit. Situational at best since you want your rats to be sacrificial most of the time. (animovore + fleshconstruct. Totem of suffering. Necrogeddon. Monstrous brood) The up part is that you only need one growth. Invest once in growth when you don&#39;t need to draw or sac for decay and you&#39;ll be able to plop this puppy down whenever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>NOTE: Unforseen assault will not trigger when you put junkyard out. Your rats will be 2-2-2 Unforseen only procs on 1 damage!!!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Scavenger construct</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Draw mainly. It&#39;s not even for blocking things, though it can be used for that in a pinch. This plus animovore allows you to turtle down hard, or provide you that extra draw you might want. This card can be sacced early if you think you won&#39;t need to turtle or won&#39;t need the extra draw.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Blade Husk</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Situational, but at the begin game you can use it for a meatshield or sacrifficial. This thing is in there to provide that extra umpf if the opponent turtles up and &nbsp;you&#39;re in a stalemate. This thing serves as a battering ram, especially when dominion is already in effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bog hound</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin game unit, body blocker. Cheap, 2-2-3, It can block, it can attack low health and is just decent in general. This scroll is cost efficient for you in the sense that it can easily block 2 damage and 1 damage opponents, have a chance to attack, or be sacrificial to your animovore construct for draw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Illmire Tribesman</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Meatshield. Don&#39;t expect him to attack. He blocks and dies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Miasma well</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Blocks for your creatures, helps you out when you need to rely more heavily on poison. Simple and clean. It brings utility that should put the board presence towards your favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Morbid curiosity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want more than 1 draw out of this, scryer with uneasy alliance or pestis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Pestis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Rats, rats, rats. Prefferably dump this on a Scryer. They will attack often and benefit most from it. You can use it on a small creature if you have a lot of rats, if you need to clear out something quickly. You&#39;ll want one or two of these on the field with scryers at some point. When saccing, don&#39;t guard these jealously but keep in mind when you&#39;ll need one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Uneasy alliance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Slam this on a scryer for high damage every turn. This can be used to kill off a high health opposing creature as well, by enchanting them and getting your own enchanted creature killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Arhart&#39;s Disciple</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>3decay &nbsp;3-2-3 Less efficient as your hound. This is a good target for pestis in a hurry. These are in the deck to be able to wittle down your opponent in a stalemate. You&#39;ll slowly VERY slowly win the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Eager Scryer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Bread and butter. Get this out and get this protected. Pestis + mangy rat for some damage, or slam him with Uneasy alliance (+pestis) and morbid curiosity and have card draw with your creature killing. To slam your game into the lategame, get one of these out, protect it well and hit him with blightseed. You get cards from his own passive + the Blightseed cards. That and some extra Decay to spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unforseen onslaught</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Situational. I don&#39;t use this a lot, but it works when you&#39;ve got enough rats out and the opponent is looking to block you off fairly heavily. This can also be used with an unbuffed scryer. Use this with pestis (with no rats out) to get your first rat out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Blightseed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Slam this on a Scryer for great carddraw. You can use it on other creatures, but scryer is most effective. This catapults you into the lategame and gets your deck going like mad. Always be sure that whatever creature you put this on, is protected!

Don&#39;t expect him to attack. He&#39;s nothing more than a glorified cardraw and damage prevention. If the opponent refuses to attack him, animovore him. Units around him die, you get some carddraw and if he draws enough, you&#39;ll get two extra cards. If not, he&#39;ll become a target and you&#39;ll still have your draw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Necrogeddon</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>late game finish and boardclear. Rack up on rats, or just slam all your cheap creatures out. Activate this, preferably with a totem of suffering.

This card can trigger your totem of suffering by turning all your weak 1-2-1 rats into 3-2-3&#39;s that buff each other. Wouldn&#39;t advice to use this on your humans as they are tanky and durable of themselves mostly (or equally to the monstrosities). A plus is that, after a Necrogeddon, if the opponent is still alive, you either : &nbsp;Kill them outright with a totem of suffering, or turn all the 3-3-2&#39;s into solid 3-2-3&#39;s into self buffing creatures that are allowed to attack a bit earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":40,"c":2},{"id":165,"c":3},{"id":242,"c":3},{"id":197,"c":2},{"id":171,"c":2},{"id":268,"c":1},{"id":269,"c":2},{"id":244,"c":2},{"id":185,"c":2},{"id":265,"c":1},{"id":201,"c":3},{"id":251,"c":2},{"id":267,"c":2},{"id":183,"c":3},{"id":199,"c":1},{"id":255,"c":3},{"id":309,"c":2},{"id":243,"c":2},{"id":264,"c":3},{"id":187,"c":3},{"id":246,"c":1},{"id":194,"c":2},{"id":188,"c":2},{"id":173,"c":1}],"name":"ratpoison","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),

Halls of oum lasa is there to ensure you have a energy siphon for each combo, at least until you run out of bombards and feedback jolts. The main strategy of this deck is to play it like a normal decay deck (play ilmire tribesman in front of rot eater, play languid on low cost threats, etc.) while spreading out enchantments to prepare for feedback jolt. I find myself sacrificing the combo early game more often than not because decay has such solid creatures that can keep board control by themselves. Most of the time it&#39;s not needed until mid-late game (approximately just after the first deck cycle) it&#39;s best to play halls of oum lasa around that point as well to prepare for heavy loses that can be replayed. Think of this deck as a decay deck with a surprise sudden eruption that can hurt all enchanted units (units with stag heart, piercing projectile, overdrive, earthen mirth, champion ring, languid, nuru&#39;s needle, etc.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deck more or less strenthens decay&#39;s match-up against energy due to the flexibility of languid and nuru&#39;s needle that they can be played on structures. The only downside it that energy siphon must be played on a creature, so in order to trigger feedback jolt against an energy deck such as MES, you must wait for them to play a creature.

The basic idea is to get units on the field, and simply overwhelm your opponent. This can be done in a number of ways, as this deck gives you many options of how to play it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategy 1 -&nbsp;<span style="color:#ffeb04;font:sFont;"><small>Kinfolk Brave/Wetland Ranger</small></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These two cards are used for keeping momentum on the board. Being able to attack each turn has a lot of advantages, and give you the option of a kill each turn. In order to give them more power, spread out your stag hearts over 2 or 3 units, so that you don&#39;t have a single point of failure that your opponent can attack. For this strategy, the Earthborn Mystics help immensely in getting all 3 Stag Hearts in hand to use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategy 2 - Wolves + Brother of the Wolf</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This set of cards is the primary backbone of the deck, and will often finish out games for you. Great Wolf can attack immediately from Rally and Mangy Wolf, and Brother of the Wolf and Ragged Wolf just ramp up the damage that can be done. Stag Heart and Earthborn Mystic are arguable even more powerful with this set of cards than with the 1 cooldown cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategy 3 - Don&#39;t forget the little guys</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This strategy is all about mass creature spam. This includes Ragged Wolf, Vaettr, Brave, Mystic, Mangy, Noadi, Terrene Brute, and Rat King. Every one of those cards gets a buff from Fjords of Vigor, and also combo quite well with the Wetland Ranger buff. With Fjords and 2 Rangers, all of the sudden your cute little creatures become giant glass cannons; they might die easily, but they can do a lot of damage. They are also so cheap that it doesn&#39;t hurt to lose a couple here and there in exchange for putting yourself in a better position. Even better is that you can put them on the board so easily that they work really well helping Terrene Brute to attack at minimum every other turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Rest of the Deck</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rumble</strong>:&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I use this in place of Quake, because you should never be in a place with this deck where Quake would hurt the enemy more than it would hurt you. The goal here is to create opportunities to either bring out units that need to be killed, or move units away from an idol in order to win a match.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kinfolk Veteran</strong>: Not much to say here, although it&#39;s hard to keep including this card in decks right now because Late Game Order makes that instant 3 attack almost useless with heavily armored units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Striped Fangbear</strong>: It&#39;s always good to have a backup plan. I include the Fangbear for it&#39;s relentless ability, and it makes a good secondary unit to attack with if the Great Wolves keep getting killed. On top of that, it also makes a very nice &quot;high-value&quot; target for the opponent to hit, to take heat off of your other (and in this case, slightly more useful) units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fjords of Vigor:</strong> This one is more personal preference than anything, but I prefer to have the constant +1 attack over 3 turns, than to have +2 attack for just one turn with Crimson Bull. Well over half of my deck can use this buff also. It&#39;s not something that I play every match, but it has pulled off a win more than once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Substitutions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vaetrr -&gt; Sister of the Fox:</strong> I include Vaetrr for the odd matches where I can use it to get a couple scrolls out earlier than normal, and I also use it as just a cheap wall late into the match. With as fast as this deck normally runs, getting a creature out 1 turn earlier doesn&#39;t make a huge difference, so the option is there to get more potential creature spam from Sister of the Fox, as well as keeping up card advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rumble -&gt; Earthen Mirth</strong>: If you aren&#39;t too worried about the few times you might wish for Rumble, you can swith it with Earthen Mirth in order to give you deck an extra kick. Being able to put a 5 attack Ragged Wolf on the field can be a huge turnaround in a match, and with an Earthborn Mystic on the field, you&#39;ve just taken out a 6 health unit. This is especially effective against order decks, and I switch it in and out depending on my mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Noaidi -&gt; Vilda the Verdant</strong>: Personally, I feel that the creature spam helps a bit more with the way this deck is structured, but if you want a bit more power on the field Vilda is a great way to go. With 1 or 2 Stag Hearts on the field, along with the Ward attribute, Vilda can certainly be a force to be reckoned with. The biggest downside is that you can only have one on the field at once, and she tends to be squishy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fjords of Vigor -&gt; Crimson Bull</strong>: As mentioned previously, this is strictly down to personal preference.</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":49,"c":3},{"id":44,"c":3},{"id":22,"c":3},{"id":38,"c":3},{"id":75,"c":3},{"id":334,"c":2},{"id":41,"c":3},{"id":208,"c":3},{"id":302,"c":3},{"id":307,"c":3},{"id":296,"c":3},{"id":21,"c":3},{"id":76,"c":3},{"id":374,"c":3},{"id":203,"c":3},{"id":156,"c":3},{"id":215,"c":3}],"name":"Quick Roots","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'growth-1.jpg', NULL),

The primary idea of this deck is to get cheap units on to the board early in the game and use them as fodder to create plays using Harvesters, Ilmire Rot Eaters, and the new Anima Conduit. The Anima Conduit plays a huge role in this deck helping you strike back at opponents by sacrificing cheap units. The Revenants that spawn off of it will also help trigger the Harvesters and can be cleverly used to build up stats on your Rot Eaters. The deck also features a uniquie hero (Irva, Voice of the Dead) who can be used in combination with these undead units to create suprise attacks and annihilate your opponents. Choose to play her right before multiple Undead units strike to catch your opponent off guard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;March of the Dead&quot; comes with a wide variety of scrolls much like the other preconstructed decks to allow players to expand their collection, while gainging some of the exciting new rares in Set 6. It also has some wonderful synergies and can be used against players and Hard AI alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To gain scrolls in this deck, players should make good use of Morbid Curiosty. Play it on a relentless creature or Irva to draw a great deal of scrolls. Also included to help you gain scrolls is a Viscera Sage and the new Halls of Oum Lasa, letting players pull from their discard pile. This card is a great resource to use in the deck to get thos top level cards back on to the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUse Shroud of Unlife to turn one of your other units Undead, thus capitalizing on Flesh Animator, Irva, and Restless Bones. Use Soul Scrounger to quickly tick down your Harvesters. And if your opponent won&#39;t let you get to his idols, punish him with Omen of Damnation or Loyal Darklings. Use Invocation Sentry and Forbidden Ruins to boost idol damage even further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy the deck and let the dead rise!</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":164,"c":2},{"id":349,"c":3},{"id":179,"c":2},{"id":268,"c":2},{"id":162,"c":2},{"id":265,"c":2},{"id":342,"c":2},{"id":350,"c":3},{"id":174,"c":2},{"id":161,"c":1},{"id":183,"c":2},{"id":344,"c":1},{"id":172,"c":2},{"id":255,"c":1},{"id":195,"c":2},{"id":166,"c":1},{"id":345,"c":2},{"id":351,"c":2},{"id":309,"c":2},{"id":540,"c":2},{"id":362,"c":1},{"id":177,"c":1},{"id":332,"c":2},{"id":353,"c":2},{"id":352,"c":2},{"id":271,"c":2},{"id":382,"c":1},{"id":343,"c":1}],"name":"March of the Dead","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, 'decay-1.jpg', NULL),

Most scrolls in here, if played right almost always will give positive value. It might be best to take out one bombard and replace it with another hired smuggler since bombard really isn&#39;t entirely needed that much. This is just what I&#39;m currently using, make any changes you want this deck isn&#39;t changing anymore. Any additional changes are your preference, this deck is mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See http://scrolldier.com/deck/2253 for the original version (it&#39;s slightly more decay focused)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deck is entirely focused around assassinating all units on the board in a quick and simple fashion. That is the mindset you should have while playing this deck, since most of the scrolls in the deck have an on hit/on-play bonus effect. The best way to use this deck is to place all the hard to remove units before playing any high damage threats/slayer units. Not only will your opponent have a hard time dealing with what is on the board, but the will also have a hard time keeping anything on the board which heavily counters combo decks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against growth, don&#39;t be afraid to place any and all four health unit in front as it will ensure that they can&#39;t get to the &#39;sticky&#39; units without the help from an enchantment or structure that buffs their damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against decay, if at all possible maintain board control at all points in the game. The obvious weakness in this match-up is the amount of units that the opponent will stick to the board and refuse to give up. When the opponent plays something big and hard to remove try and not deal with it until the answer appears in your hand (aka rot eater is played and you have baleful witch and cursed presence or a cursemonger is on your side and they play a witch doctor and you have the same hand). This match-up all relies on the cleanest removal and not allowing anything to stick on the board. If you can keep more things on the board than your opponent you should be in good shape to win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against structures, nuru&#39;s needle is more often than not the best answer. Who doesn&#39;t want a health decrease and damage increase against structures as decay? It&#39;s also versatile as it can be used on any unit, so you can prevent those pesky high health structures from blocking the more threatening creatures from your harvesters. It turns out to be a win-win scenario in most cases it&#39;s used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against order, just consitently clear the board. So long as there are very few units in play, you should be fine against most of their units. Curse and ranged attacks tend to deal with order&#39;s threats very easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haven&#39;t really faced any energy decks to say how to deal with them, but I would assume that playing anything with 3 or less health would generally be a no go. Other than that, I think that match-up would go somewhat smoothly toward Ranged Decay 2.0.</p>\r\n', 0, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":205,"c":3},{"id":185,"c":1},{"id":225,"c":3},{"id":244,"c":3},{"id":281,"c":2},{"id":276,"c":3},{"id":350,"c":3},{"id":152,"c":3},{"id":172,"c":3},{"id":183,"c":3},{"id":195,"c":3},{"id":272,"c":3},{"id":200,"c":3},{"id":245,"c":3},{"id":194,"c":3},{"id":382,"c":2},{"id":166,"c":3},{"id":309,"c":3}],"name":"","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),

Still a mostly for fun deck, I haven&#39;t had the balls to take it to ranked, but it can destroy a lot of the hard trials. The main combo this deck is based around is Earthborn Mystic + Bloodboil + Vengeance Veil + Machination Mindset + Oak Blood/Verdent Veil + Leeching Ring, which allows for an infinite attack relentless mystic and infinite enchantment draw. This is a lot easier to get down than it looks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on you&#39;re going to want to get up to 4 or so reasources, and look for any parts of the combo you are missing. The most important scrolls to have early are bloodboil and vengence veil. You will want to draw your opponents early forces to one side of the board by playing a nogs nest or wildling or something else they feel they have to deal with. Then you&#39;re going to want to play your combo creature on the other side of the board where it is safe for a few turns. This should be a mystic, although a wildling is also very good for combos. Ideally next turn you will play a health buff on it, verdant veil is very good as it also gives ward. When the mystic&#39;s health becomes 0, that is when you make your play. Bloodboil (alternatively noadi) into vengence veil, and then you can use the mystics ability multiple times to hopefully draw the rest of the combo. If you draw it, play machination mindset with your wild. In the next turn or so, make sure you play potion of resistance and verdant veil on the mystic, which will make it unkillable, as well as multiple leeching rings to keep its health high. Once the mystic is on the feild it is pretty much gg, just protect your idols with rat king, potion of resistance and nogs nest, and use quake and frost gale to make the mystic attack every turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside of combo decks is that they are usually unreliable. However, this deck includes many alternatives so that if you cannot draw a certain scroll you can still play the combo. Wilding is still good for bloodboil + machination mindset + leeching ring combos, which are also very powerful. Somata shift and eye of eagle both have 1/3 chance of giving a mystic and 1/3 chance of a wildling. If you don&#39;t have bloodboil you can still get wild through noadi, and play bloodboil later. Vengeance veil has no alternative although it is not needed on a wildling. Once you get mystic + vengeance veil you will usually be able to draw into the rest of the combo and the means to protect it.</p>\r\n', 1, '{"msg":"success","data":{"scrolls":[{"id":47,"c":3},{"id":213,"c":3},{"id":97,"c":3},{"id":104,"c":3},{"id":294,"c":3},{"id":154,"c":3},{"id":84,"c":3},{"id":203,"c":3},{"id":148,"c":3},{"id":302,"c":3},{"id":34,"c":2},{"id":377,"c":3},{"id":89,"c":3},{"id":29,"c":3},{"id":215,"c":3},{"id":378,"c":3},{"id":43,"c":3}],"name":"Veiled Mystic: A Combo Deck","deleted":0,"resources":["growth"]},"apiversion":1}', 0, 0, '', NULL),
